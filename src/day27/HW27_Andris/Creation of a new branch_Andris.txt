Creation of a new branch + PULL REQUEST Option 1 (only throw IntelliJ IDEA)      Git commands            My text        //comments            START1. Go to Java Project “TM14Class” terminal2. In opened terminal enter: git checkout -b “day26_homework” //creation of a new branch3. Check what is happening: git status4. We see the files which are red (not added yet)5. Add files that we want to send to GitHub using a full Linux route: git add src/day26/hw_Andris/Homework266. git status7. System says that the files are ready to be committed8. git commit -m “Homework26”9. git push origin day26_homework10.  Open GitHub repository (forked one) 11. Create a pull request to send all data to the MASTER repository of our teacher* Option 1 – through link provided in IDEA terminal. Just clicking the link, we gonna be redirecting directly to the window in GitHub where we just enter the comment and NUMBER of the task ( For example: “Homework26_Andris #36”. Press the green button PULL REQUEST* Option 2 – after pushing the files through IDEA Terminal we go to GitHub, open Pull Request section, check if we have correct data there, push the green button PULL REQUEST.Double check, if the pushed homework/file has been appeared in the master repository and is open for everyone nowENDUPSTREAM branch CREATIONWe update our UPSTREAM fork (“Upstream” is just a name of our branch) to be sure that our fork is up to date with the main master branch (branch of our teacher)If UPSTREAM has not been created yet:1. Go to our IDEA project folder in Application sections2. Choose the correct project (for example BMClass)3. Open folder and choose SRC folder4. With right mouse click open EXPLORER on MacBook5. Write git status in opened terminal6. git remote -v     // so we can check what has already been added7. Open GitHub, find the Master Branch and copy SSH code of Branch repository8. Go back to Explorer9. git remote add upstream “add SSH link here”  // git will add a new branch with a name “upstream” and she will be connected with main branch through the SSH linkUPSTREAM UPDATE1. In IDEA terminal or EXPLORER terminal enter git status2. git fetch upstream  // prepare and download all updates of UPSTREAM branch3. git checkout master   //must to see the message that branch is actual with master branch4. git rebase upstream/master // so we get all new files from the main branch directly to our UPSTREAM branch and can see them in our IDEA project folder
